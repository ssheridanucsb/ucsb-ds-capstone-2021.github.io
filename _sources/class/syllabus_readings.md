Readings will be assigned from the book, _Think Like a Data Scientist_ (TLDS) by Brian Godsey, and, occasionally, other readings that are not in the textbook.  These readings will cover additional aspects of data science project organization, reproducibility, collaboration, communication, and ethics.

You will be reading and making comments on the text via Google docs or the pdfs in your browser window.
